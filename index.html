                <h1>GENERAL FEATURES</h1>
                <p>The mine is cold, damp, and surprisingly drafty. A noticeable breeze blows through many of its passages, flowing from area 1 toward area 16.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Ceilings.</b> Tunnels are 10 feet high unless noted otherwise. Rooms have 20-foot-high ceilings, while natural caverns have 30-foot-high ceilings dotted with stalactites.</li>
                    <li><b>Doors.</b>Unless noted otherwise, all doors are 6 feet tall, 4 feet wide, and made of six-inch-thick cut slabs of stone fitted with iron handles and hinges. The doors are low and wide-perfect for dwarves.</li>
                    <li><b>Wal1s.</b>The walls are hewn stone. In a few areas (14, 15, 19, and 20), they are dressed with well-fitted stone blocks.</li>
                    <li><b>Floors.</b> All floors are smooth, natural stone.</li>
                    <li><b>Light.</b> None unless otherwise indicated. The boxed text assumes that the characters have light sources or darkvision.</li>
                    <li><b>Stalagmites.</b> Found in many of the natural caverns, these spires of rock rise up from the floor and can be used for cover (see "Cover" in the rulebook).</li>

                    <h3>BOOMINC WAVES</h3>
                    <p>All good dungeons have characteristics that make them unique, and Wave Echo Cave is no exception. The rhythmic thunder of pounding waves echoes throughout the mine, loud enough
                        to make the stone underfoot shiver. Waves come about two minutes apart, growing louder toward the northeast.</p>
                    <p>Wave Echo Cave is nowhere near the ocean, but a water-filled cavern deep in the mine is connected to an underground hot spring. That spring boils over continuously to produce 
                        a surge that slams into a narrow funnel, making a sound like breaking surf. Describe this sound to players on occasion. It will pique their curiosity and lure them toward its source, 
                        drawing them deeper into the mine as a consequence.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>WANDERING MONSTERS</h3>
                <p class="hazard">If the characters spend a long time in a given area, you can check for wandering monsters by rolling a d20. On a roll of 17-20, an encounter takes place. Conversely, 
                       if the players seem restless, you can decide that an encounter occurs. Roll a d12 and consult the Wandering Monsters table to determine what the party meets.</p>

                <h1>1.CAVE ENTRANCE</h1>
                <p>Whether the characters follow Gundren's map or receive directions to Wave Echo Cave from another source, their initial approach leads them to a narrow tunnel whose entrance is hidden within the Sword Mountain foothills.</p>
                <p class="readAloud">The entrance tunnel leads into a large-cavern supported by a natural pillar of rock and containing three stalagmites. In the western part of the cave, behind the column of rock, are three bedrolls and a heap 
                    of ordinary supplies-sacks of flour, bags of salt, casks of salted meat, lanterns, flasks of lamp oil, pickaxes, shovels, and other gear. Amid the supplies, you see the body of a dwarf miner, dead for at least a week.
                    The northeastern section of the cavern has collapsed, forming a ten-foot-wide, twenty-foot-deep pit. A sturdy hemp rope is tied off around a nearby stalagmite and dangles down the side of the pit, at the bottom of which is 
                    a rough-hewn tunnel heading northwest and east.</p>

                <p class="hazard">This was the campsite of the Rockseekers. The dead dwarf is Tharden, Gundren's brother, who was killed by the Black Spider. Gundren's other brother, Nundro, was here as well and is currently the Black Spider's prisoner in area 20.
                    The dwarves' supplies are potentially useful, but not particularly valuable.</p>
                <p><b>Open Pit.</b> Climbing up or down the wall of the pit without a rope requires a successful DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check. A character who fails the check by 5
                    or more falls and takes Id6 bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen, landing prone at the bottom. The tunnel at the bottom of the pit leads northwest toward area 2 and east toward area 3.</p>
                <h3>TREASURE</h3>
                <p class="rewards">Tharden wears a pair of <b>boots of striding and springing.</b> In his haste to explore the rest of Wave Echo Cave, Nezznar overlooked them.<br><br>
                  <b>BOOTS OF STRIDING AND SPRINGING</b><br>
                <i>Your speed while you wear these boots becomes 30 feet, unless your walking speed is higher, and your speed is not reduced if you are encumbered or wearing heavy armor.
                   In addition, whenever you jump, you can jump three times the normal distance.</i></p>

                <h1>2. MINE TUNNELS</h1>
                <p>This maze of passages is an old section of Wave EchoCave's original mine site.</p>
                <p class="readAloud">This area consists of numerous intersecting passages. The ceilings here are only six feet high, and several of the passages end in partially excavated rock faces.</p>
                <p class="hazard">The dead-end passages are places where the miners gave up and decided to move on to other spots. Patiently lurking in one is an <b>ochre jelly.</b> When the party enters this section of the mine, 
                    the jelly begins to stalk the group, instinctively waiting for an opportunity to attack a lone target.</p>

                <h1>3. OLD ENTRANCE</h1>
                <p>The tunnel that runs south was the original entrance to Wave Echo Cave, but it was buried by the destruction that wrackedtheminescenturiesago.Apitchedbattlewas fought here when the ores stormed the mines.</p>
                <p class="readAloud">Many tunnels intersect at this natural, thirty-foot-high cavern. The walls are carved with simple reliefs showing dwarf and gnome miners hard at work. Below them, nearly two dozen skeletons in 
                    rusted scraps of armor are scattered across the cavern floor. Some are dwarf skeletons, while others are orc remains. Half a dozen large brass lanterns stand in niches or on ledges around the cavern, but none are lit.</p>
                <p class="hazard">Clinging to the ceiling like bats are <b>ten stirges.</b> The monsters find scant living prey in the mines, and they are ravenous. If the characters are looking down at
                    the skeletons on the floor, the stirges are likely get the drop on them. Any character who isn't watching the ceiling is surprised unless his or her passive Wisdom (Perception) score is higher than the stirges' 
                    Dexterity (Stealth) check total (roll once for all of them). Characters who aren't surprised hear a flapping noise as the stirges descend to attack.<br>
                    The lanterns and the carvings of miners at work were meant as a welcome to newcomers.</p>

                <p class="readAloud">Splintered stone benches and heaps of rubble from a partially collapsed ceiling fill this room. Amid ruined stone bunks and toppled weapon racks are the bones of several dwarves and orcs.</p>
                <p class="hazard">In the round after any living creature enters this chamber, the bones begin to stir and knit together, <b>forming nine skeletons.</b> They fight until destroyed.</p>
